- 👋 Hi, I’m Moe (DLord)
- 👀 I’m interested in anything computer, specially coding.
- 🌱 I’m done learning Python, and have added it to my long list of learned coding languages (Basic, Pascal, Cobol, C, C++, JS, and ofcourse Assembly which I hate!)
- 💞️ I’m willing to collaborate on any non-profit computer programming projects.
- 📫 I could be reached via email: survival@iname.com
