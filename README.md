- 👋 Hi, I’m Moe (DLord)
- 👀 I’m interested in anything computers, specially coding.
- 🌱 I’m done learning Python, and have added it to my long list of learned coding languages (Basic, Pascal, Cobol, C, C++, JS, and of course Assembly which I _hate_!)    
- ⭐ Currently developing apps for my personal use/needs, while having fun doing so.  :relaxed:    
- 💞️ I’m willing to collaborate on any non-profit programming/development project.
- 📫 I could be reached via email: DLord420@mail.com
