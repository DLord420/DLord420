- 👋 Hi, I’m DLord.
- 👀 I’m interested in anything computers, specially coding.  I started coding on [_C128_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_128), long long time ago.  
- 🌱 I’m still practicing and learning new coding languages to add to my long list (Basic, Pascal, Cobol, C, C++, JS, Python, HTML, CSS, and of course Assembly which I _hate_!)    
- ⭐ I'm currently developing apps for my personal use/needs, while having fun doing so.  :relaxed:    
- 💞️ I’m willing to collaborate on any non-profit programming/development project.
- 📫 I could be reached via email: DLord420@mail.com
