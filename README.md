- 👋 Hi, I’m Moe (DLord)
- 👀 I’m interested in anything computer, specially coding.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, to add it to my long list of coding languages (Basic, Pascal, Cobol, C, C++, JS, and ofcourse Assembly which I hate!)
- 💞️ I’m willing to collaborate on any computer programming projects.
- 📫 I could be reached via email: survival@iname.com
